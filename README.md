## Deliverable 2- The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program

## Deliverable 3- Provide a written report of the database analysis

**Overview of the anlaysis**

 * We were charged with determining the number of employees retiring by title as well as to identify employees who are eligible for mentorship. 
     

**Conclusion** 

 * It has been determined that a fairly high number of individuals qualify for retirement in the near term. The following is a breakout of that data by title
    > * Assistant Engineer: 4,584
    > * Engineer: 34,559 
    > * Manager: 6
    > * Senior Engineer: 29,415
    > * Senior Staff: 28,256
    > * Staff: 32,452
    > * Technique Leader: 4,504
    

     The results of the analysis are concerning due to the fact that there are 133,776 employees eligible for retirement in the near term and only 1,941 employees eligible for the mentorship program. This is quite a disparity
